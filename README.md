# Assignment: Enhancing HTML5 Content & Mastering Forms

## Overview

This assignment focuses on elevating HTML5 skills by working with advanced content elements and mastering the creation, structure, and validation of web forms. The project showcases the use of lists, tables, and media to enrich page content, and then dives deep into building a dynamic, user-friendly form powered by native HTML5 features.

## Objectives

This project demonstrates the ability to:
* Use lists and tables effectively to organize content.
* Embed media content using semantic HTML5 elements.
* Build a structured, usable, and intuitive HTML5 form.
* Apply various HTML5 form attributes to improve user interaction.
* Use built-in validation techniques to ensure data integrity without JavaScript.

## Key Features & Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Enriched Content
* **Semantic Lists:** Use of `<ul>` to present prerequisite information clearly.
* **Structured Tables:** A `<table>` with `<thead>` and `<tbody>` is used to display a schedule in a structured and accessible manner.
* **Embedded Media:** The page includes a `<video>` element with browser controls and an `<img>` element with a descriptive `alt` attribute for accessibility.

### 2. Advanced HTML5 Forms
* **Structure & Accessibility:**
    * The form is organized into logical groups using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements.
    * Every input field is paired with a `<label>` using the `for` attribute to ensure accessibility.
* **Variety of Input Types:** The form utilizes a wide range of input types, including `text`, `email`, `password`, `radio`, and `checkbox`.
* **Helpful Form Attributes:** Attributes like `placeholder`, `autocomplete`, and `readonly` are used to enhance the user experience.
* **Native HTML5 Validation:** Form integrity is enforced solely through HTML5, with no JavaScript. This includes:
    * **`required`**: Ensures critical fields are not left empty.
    * **`type="email"`**: Provides built-in validation for email address formatting.
    * **`minlength`**: Sets a minimum character length for password security.
    * **`pattern`**: Uses a regular expression to enforce a specific format for the username.
